## Introduction

The sentiment of social media can often reflect and sometimes predict stock market trends. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of tweets about Tesla. By correlating this sentiment with Tesla stock prices, the project aims to uncover potential patterns and insights.

## Dataset

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: 
    - Use the Twitter API to collect tweets mentioning Tesla.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Clean and preprocess tweets (remove hashtags, mentions, URLs, etc.).

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
    - Use Hugging Face transformers to analyze the sentiment of each tweet.
    - Classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

4. **Data Analysis**:
    - Analyze the correlation between tweet sentiment and stock price movements.
    - Use statistical methods to uncover patterns.
